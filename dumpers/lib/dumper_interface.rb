# To implement a dumper:
# * Create a .rb file named after the dumper in 'dumpers'
# * Require this file: require_relative 'lib/dumper_interface'
# * Declare a class SomeDumper, inheriting from DumperInterface
# * Implement one or more of the functions listed below (at least dump_msg)

# Note:
#   Dumpers are a low-level construct and as of v2.0.0 they are no longer used
#   for implementing custom output formats. Instead, custom formatters have been
#   introduced for this purpose (see /formatters/lib/formatter_base.rb).

  # Will be called before backing up the first dialog
  # Can be used for initialization

  # Will be called just before dumping a dialog's messages
  def start_dialog(dialog, progress)
    # dialog: Hash, progress: DumpProgress
    nil
  end

  # Will be called before each message to dump, to determine whether it is new
  # enough to back up
  # This default makes sense in simple cases, override for advanced custom logic
  def msg_fresh?(msg, progress)
    # msg: Hash, progress: DumpProgress

  # Will be called for each message to dump (from newest to oldest)
  # See the python binding documentation to get an idea of the msg attributes:
  # https://github.com/vysheng/tg/blob/master/README-PY.md#attributes-1
  # Returning boolean false causes an early abort (skips to the next dialog)
  def dump_msg(dialog, msg)
    # dialog, msg: Hash
